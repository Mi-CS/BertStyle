# Unsupervised Contrastive Learning of Style using a pre-trained BERT

### ***[Under construction]***

This repository contains the code necessary to fine-tune a BERT model in order to obtain style representations. 

A minimal example on how to use it can be found in `notebooks/training_example.ipynb`.
